### Recurrence picker NORMAL cells: Material FAB → fake-FAB
`RecurrencePickerAdapter`'s `NormalViewHolder` swapped Material FAB
for a fake-FAB (FrameLayout + bg View + RippleDrawable foreground,
mirroring `color_picker_fab.xml`). This lets picked cells carry a real
OVAL `GradientDrawable` instead of being flattened to representative
via `setBackgroundTintList`. The ripple waveform itself remains
single-int representative (Android `RippleDrawable` `ColorStateList`
limit) — assessed acceptable; "real-gradient ripple via custom touch
animation" is a follow-up, not Phase 8 scope.

### Gradient signal propagation into all DateTime/Habit/AudioRecord dialogs
Phase 8 extended into `InputLayout`, `TimeOfDayRecAdapter`,
`RecurrencePickerAdapter` — each grew a `setAccentBackground(ThingBackground)`
entry, with text colours migrated to `BackgroundUtil.applyTextBackground`
and other paths kept on representative int.

### Plan §4.7.4 "FAB tint must be single int" is overruled where fake-FAB is feasible
The COLOR_MIGRATION_PLAN.md classification of FAB as "single-int only"
was too conservative — the fake-FAB pattern bypasses the API
restriction by replacing the widget. Plan §4.7.4 still applies to
genuine Android-API single-int seams (Notification.setColor,
PorterDuff tints, EdgeEffect.setColor, RippleDrawable ColorStateList).
