## 2026-05-27 - ThingsActivity header collapse endpoint is measured, not density-guessed

`ActivityHeader` should not rely on hard-coded `scrollY * factor` values to
place the title inside the toolbar when the Things list collapses. Those factors
only matched the original Chinese/English text metrics on common toolbar
heights; they drift with other locales, fallback fonts, font scale, device
metrics, and any toolbar height variant.

Keep the legacy collapse distance and title scale timing, but compute the
collapsed header `translationY` from measured coordinates: toolbar vertical
centre minus the scaled title visual centre. Interpolate from `0` to that
measured endpoint while scrolling. Recompute after title text changes so locale
or drawer-category changes can update the endpoint.

## 2026-05-27 - App language selection uses AppCompat locales plus context wrapping

The old in-app language path mutated only `App.getApp().resources` through
`Resources.updateConfiguration(...)`. That is not a reliable Activity
localisation boundary after the Android 16 / AppCompat update, especially when
the selected app language differs from the system language.

Use a two-layer locale path instead:
- wrap `Application` and Activity base contexts from the stored app-language
  preference so resources are correct before layout inflation;
- keep `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales(...)` in sync so AppCompat and
  Android's per-app language machinery see the same locale.

Settings language preselection must compare saved language codes, not displayed
language names, because displayed names are locale-dependent and can belong to
the previous resource configuration.
