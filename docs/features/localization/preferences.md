# Localization Preferences

Migrated from global `memory/preferences.md` on 2026-06-06. This file keeps feature-scoped history out of startup memory while preserving the original notes.

## Localization

When adding or revising translations, use `values-zh-rCN/strings.xml` as the
source of truth. Do not use Google Translate for this project unless the user
explicitly re-authorizes it. Prefer direct agent-authored translations over
API-generated batches, especially for long Help/About text.

Exception authorized on 2026-05-27: Google Translate may be used for bulk
Simplified Chinese translation of the `meodai/color-names` colour-name dataset.
This exception is scoped to fine-grained colour-name labels only. English colour
names should keep the upstream source wording, and non-Chinese app locales may
fall back to English until explicitly translated later.
